# envfly login

Authenticate with EnvFly Cloud Service to access team features and cloud storage.

## Usage

```bash
envfly login
```

## Description

The `login` command authenticates you with the EnvFly Cloud Service. This is required for:

- Using EnvFly Cloud Service as a storage provider
- Team management features
- Cross-team environment sharing
- Audit logs and analytics

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication (Recommended)

```bash
$ envfly login
API Key: ********
```

You'll be prompted to enter your API key. The key will be stored securely in your system's keychain.

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Sign up** at [app.envfly.io](https://app.envfly.io)
2. **Navigate** to your profile settings
3. **Generate** a new API key
4. **Copy** the key and use it with the login command

<Callout type="warning">
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never share them or commit them to version
  control.
</Callout>

## Secure Storage

Your API key is stored securely using your system's keychain:

- **macOS**: Keychain Access
- **Linux**: Secret Service API (GNOME Keyring/KWallet)
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager

## Verification

After login, verify your authentication:

```bash
# Check authentication status
envfly auth status

# Test API connection
envfly list
```

## Logout

To log out and remove stored credentials:

```bash
envfly logout
```

This will remove your API key from the system keychain.

## Examples

### Basic Login

```bash
$ envfly login
Welcome to EnvFly Cloud Service!

Please enter your API key to authenticate.
You can find your API key at: https://app.envfly.io/settings/api-keys

API Key: ********
✅ Authentication successful!

You are now logged in as: alice@company.com
Team: Backend Team

```

### Login with Environment Variable

You can also provide the API key via environment variable:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export ENVFLY_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Login (will use environment variable)
envfly login
```

### Login for CI/CD

For automated environments, use environment variables:

```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
export ENVFLY_API_KEY="${{ secrets.ENVFLY_API_KEY }}"
envfly login
envfly pull production
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid API Key

```bash

⚠️  Warning: Could not store API key securely
