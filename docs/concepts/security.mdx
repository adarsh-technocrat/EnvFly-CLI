# Security

EnvFly CLI is built with security as a top priority. This page explains the security features and best practices for keeping your environment variables safe.

## Encryption

### Client-Side Encryption

All environment variables are encrypted **before** they leave your machine. EnvFly CLI uses industry-standard encryption to ensure your secrets remain private.

<Grid cols={2}>
  <Card title="Encryption Algorithm">
    **AES-256-GCM** - 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode
    for authenticated encryption - Provides both confidentiality and integrity
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key Derivation">
    **PBKDF2** - Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 - 100,000 iterations
    for key stretching - Salted to prevent rainbow table attacks
  </Card>
</Grid>

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

EnvFly CLI follows a zero-knowledge approach:

<Mermaid>
  graph LR A[Your Machine] --> B[Encrypt with your key] B --> C[Encrypted data]
  C --> D[Storage Provider] D --> E[Server never sees plaintext]
</Mermaid>

- **Your encryption key never leaves your machine**
- **Storage providers only see encrypted data**
- **Even EnvFly servers cannot decrypt your secrets**
- **You control access to your data**

## Key Management

### Encryption Key Storage

For different storage providers, keys are managed differently:

#### Git Repository

```bash
# You provide the encryption key during init
Enter encryption key for Git storage: ********
```

**Security Considerations:**

- Store your encryption key securely
- Consider using a password manager
- Never commit the key to version control
- Share the key securely with team members

#### Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

```bash
# Keys are managed by the cloud provider
# EnvFly CLI uses your cloud credentials
aws configure
az login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Security Benefits:**

- Leverages cloud provider security
- IAM/role-based access control
- Automatic key rotation
- Audit logging

#### EnvFly Cloud Service

```bash
# API keys are stored securely using keytar
envfly login
```

**Security Features:**

- API keys stored in system keychain
- Automatic key validation
- Secure token refresh

## Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions

When using EnvFly Cloud Service, you can assign different roles to team members:

<Grid cols={3}>
  <Card title="Admin">
    - Full access to all environments - Team management - Audit logs -
    Configuration changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer">
    - Read/write access to assigned environments - Can push and pull
    environments - View environment history
  </Card>
  <Card title="Readonly">
    - Read-only access to assigned environments - Can pull environments - View
    environment history - No modification rights
  </Card>
</Grid>

### Environment-Level Access

Granular permissions per environment:

```bash
# Grant specific access to an environment
envfly team grant alice@company.com production readwrite

# Grant read-only access
envfly team grant bob@company.com staging readonly

# Grant access to specific variables only
envfly team grant charlie@company.com production readonly --keys API_KEY,DATABASE_URL
```

### Cross-Team Sharing

Share environments between teams with controlled access:

```bash
# Share environment with another team
envfly team share-env production frontend-team

# Grant specific permissions to shared environment
envfly team grant frontend-team production readonly
```

## Audit Logging

### Comprehensive Audit Trail

All actions are logged for security and compliance:

```bash
# View audit logs for an environment
envfly audit production
```

**Logged Events:**

- Environment pushes and pulls
- Team member invitations
- Permission changes
- Access attempts
- Configuration modifications

### Audit Log Details

Each audit entry includes:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "user": "alice@company.com",
  "action": "environment.push",
  "environment": "production",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "envfly-cli/1.0.0",
  "details": {
    "variables_modified": 3,
    "variables_added": 1,
    "variables_removed": 0
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Encryption Key Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Strong Keys">
    Generate strong, random encryption keys: ```bash # Generate a strong key
    openssl rand -base64 32 ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Secure Key Storage">
    Store encryption keys securely: - Use a password manager - Never store in
    plain text files - Don't commit to version control - Share securely with
    team members
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Key Rotation">
    Rotate encryption keys periodically: - Generate new keys every 6-12 months -
    Re-encrypt all environments with new keys - Update team members with new
    keys
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Access Control

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Grant only necessary permissions: - Start with read-only access - Escalate
    permissions as needed - Regularly review and revoke unused access
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Team Management">
    Manage team membership carefully: - Remove former employees immediately -
    Use invite codes for new members - Monitor team access regularly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Environment Isolation">
    Separate environments by sensitivity: - Production: Restricted access -
    Staging: Developer access - Development: Open access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Network Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS">
    Always use HTTPS for API communication: - EnvFly CLI enforces HTTPS - Verify
    SSL certificates - Use corporate proxies if required
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Network Restrictions">
    Restrict network access where possible: - Use VPN for remote access -
    Configure firewall rules - Monitor network traffic
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Rate Limiting">
    Be aware of rate limits: - Respect API rate limits - Implement exponential
    backoff - Monitor for unusual activity
