## Why EnvFly CLI?

### The Problem

Managing environment variables across teams is challenging:

- **Security**: Sharing secrets via Slack, email, or docs is risky
- **Version Control**: No history of changes or rollback capability
- **Team Coordination**: Hard to keep everyone in sync
- **Deployment**: Manual copying between environments is error-prone

### The Solution

EnvFly CLI provides:

- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage with multiple provider options
- **Version Control**: Full history and rollback capabilities
- **Team Sync**: Automatic synchronization across team members
- **Deployment Ready**: Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Quick Start

# Install EnvFly CLI
npm install -g envfly-cli

# Initialize in your project
envfly init

# Push your environment variables
envfly push production

# Share with your team
